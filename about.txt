I’m a game developer focused on atmospheric, retro-inspired experiences and practical tooling. I care about clean pipelines, sustainable production, and helping small teams ship.

**Skills:** Unity (C#), custom editor tools, PSX-style rendering, mission/encounter design, Blender, Git LFS.

**Currently:** Building portfolio pieces and open-sourcing small utilities.

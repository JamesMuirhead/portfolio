I’m a game designer and developer based in Scotland. I've worked accross mission, live ops and systems design. I’ve contributed to titles for Hangar 13 and Electric Square, and I’m now building my own studio, Deep Crypt Games, where I’m developing a Gaelic-language horror game called *Highland Trip*.

Before founding Deep Crypt, I worked as a Mission Designer on *Mafia: The Old Country* with Hangar 13, owning an hour of gameplay, responsible for implementing content and responding to director and playtest feedback. Before that, I was a Live Ops Designer on *Warped Kart Racers*, Apple Arcade’s longest-supported title, where I focused on player retention, balance, and event design. Those experiences—AAA storytelling on one hand and live-service experimentation on the other—have given me a broad understanding of the games industry as a whole.

Deep Crypt Games grew from a desire to make smaller, stranger, and more personal work that speak to place, memory, and language. *Highland Trip* draws on Scottish landscapes, Celtic tradition, and my experiences growing up in rural Scotland. I’m using horror as a way to explore nostalgia and the uncanny.

My current hyperfixations outside of making games are painting Warhammer 40K and brewing single-origin coffee.

Expanded the core experience with weekly tournaments and milestone-based rewards.  
Designed new AI difficulty tiers and implemented hidden rubber-banding systems to maintain fair challenge at higher leagues.  

### Elimination

A battle-royale-inspired mode where the player in last place is removed at timed intervals until one remains.  
Served as prototype for later modes, establishing a consistent UX flow and modifier rhythm for live events.  

### Crowned

Introduced asymmetric competition where the crowned player earns double points but can be dethroned by others.  
Balanced AI targeting and temporary buffs to maintain fair, exciting matches.  

### Overcharged

Removed random items, replacing them with a drift-powered battery mechanic that directly affects kart speed and boost.  
Focused on rewarding precision and mastery for competitive players.

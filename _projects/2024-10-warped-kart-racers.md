## Featured Game Modes

### League
Expanded the core experience with weekly tournaments and milestone-based rewards.  
Designed new AI difficulty tiers and implemented hidden rubber-banding systems to maintain fair challenge at higher leagues.

### Elimination
A battle-royale-inspired mode where the player in last place is removed at timed intervals until one remains.  
Served as prototype for later modes, establishing a consistent UX flow and modifier rhythm for live events.

### Crowned
Introduced asymmetric competition where the crowned player earns double points but can be dethroned by others.  
Balanced AI targeting and temporary buffs to maintain fair, exciting matches.

Focused on rewarding precision and mastery for competitive players.

## Summary

- Built an objective system that randomly spawns goals at preset locations, inspired by *Slender*.  
- Designed and implemented an AI aggression system that scales with player location and progress.  
- Created six unique enemy behaviours including **mimicking**, **taunting**, and **chasing**.  
- Recorded, mixed, and implemented 3D audio barks for both monster and player.  
- Tuned behavioural parameters to maximize player tension and unease.
